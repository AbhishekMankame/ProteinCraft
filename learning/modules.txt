## What is FASTA format?
FASTA is a text-based file format for representing biological sequences - like protein or nucleotide sequences (DNA/RNA). It's universally used in bioinformatics tools and databases.

Basic FASTA format structure:
A FASTA file consists of:
1. Header line (starts with >) - describes the sequence.
2. Sequence lines - actual sequence data (letters representing nucleotides or amino acids)

Example"
>sequence_1

>sequence_2
MPEFQVVAQFVEKAKGVIAGGLGDLFMRHQTGGQLLPVLH...

Key points of FASTA format:
- Each sequence entry starts with a header line beginning with ?
- The header can include a name or description
- The next lines are the sequence itself (can be multiple line for readibility)
- No strict requirement for line length, but ofter 60-80 characters per line
