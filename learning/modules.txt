## What is FASTA format?
FASTA is a text-based file format for representing biological sequences - like protein or nucleotide sequences (DNA/RNA). It's universally used in bioinformatics tools and databases.

Basic FASTA format structure:
A FASTA file consists of:
1. Header line (starts with >) - describes the sequence.
2. Sequence lines - actual sequence data (letters representing nucleotides or amino acids)
